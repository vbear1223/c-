Tic Tac Toe 

Game rules
This is a two-player game between a human player and the computer. Players will each place a piece on the 3x3 board. Their aim is to get three in a row before the other does. The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
Program's function
Player makes their move by entering the row and column numbers that they want to mark as 'X'. 
The program then checks whether the move is valid or not, and marks the cell with 'X' if it is.
The computer then makes its move by generating random row and column numbers. Check if the corresponding cell is empty, and mark it with 'O'.
After each move, the program checks the rows, columns, and diagonals of the game board for three consecutive 'X' or 'O' characters and check whether either the human player or the computer has won the game 
The game continues until when the game board is full, tie, or one of the players wins.

Challenges Faced
I was stuck when deciding which game I should choose to create. I was also unsure how to create some functions as well as the computer section.
